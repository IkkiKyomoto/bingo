# bingo
This code simulates a single round of a Bingo game and returns the number of calls it took to achieve a Bingo. The Bingo card has a size of 5x5, with a pre-cut hole in the center. Similar to a typical Bingo card, 24 numbers are randomly selected from 1 to 75 and placed in the squares of the card, excluding the center square. The numbers called are from 1 to 75, and the order of the calls is also random.
